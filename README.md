# ConcurrentAirportSimulation
This Java program simulates airport operations, focusing on plane landings, taxiing, gate assignments, and takeoffs. The simulation employs multi-threading to reflect real-time processes, managing landing queues, gate availability, and refueling.

The simulation employs multi-threading to reflect real-time processes, managing landing queues, gate availability, and refueling. The program addresses concurrency challenges and critical sections to ensure smooth operations and realistic timing.

Features
